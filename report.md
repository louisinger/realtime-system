# Real-time systems : TP2

## 1.Introduction

### Question 1
see `tp2_1.c`.

## 2. Sporadic tasks

### Question 2
see `tp2_2.c`.

### Question 3
see `tp2_3.c`.

### Question 4
For example, if we send more than two signals to the process. It only executes the do_work code two times.

### Question 5
see `tp2_5.c`.

## Periodic tasks

### Question 6
With alarm = `tp2_6.c`.
With sleep = `tp2_6bis.c`.
With these methods, we can't set a periodic task with an execution time greater than the period because we wait the end of the job before set another alarm or sleep another time.

### Question 7
see `tp2_7.c`.

### Question 8
